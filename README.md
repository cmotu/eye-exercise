# eye-exercise
##Title of the project: Eye Exercise
Description of the project: This project currently displays a set of objects that look like eyes, that will track your mouse movement across the page.
How to Run: To run this on your machine, you can simply drag the link to your web browser and wait for it to load. Once it has, you can move your mouse across the page and see how the eyes are able to track it.
Roadmap of future improvements: In the future I would like to add more functionality or possibly more facial features that can be included and displayed.
License information: This project was created with MITx Pro women's cohort and is under their licensing.
